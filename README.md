# The XITE

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a web app that fetches and displays a list of music videos. It also
supports client-side filtering, searching, and infinite scrolling.

## Getting start

In the project directory, install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

You can now see the app in the browser:

Local: http://localhost:3000

On Your Network: http://192.168.1.102:3000
